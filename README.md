# General Design Guidelines

Further explanation for the design portion of your marks.  

Every major issue I find bumps your design mark down by 1. (5 to a 4, 3 to a 2, etc.)  

Every 3 minor issues is worth 1 major issue. 

## Major Issues

- [ ] you have 5 or more confusingly-named variables and/or constants
- [ ] you don’t provide comments for things that are not obvious from the code itself 
- [ ] your variable and/or constant names aren’t expressive
- [ ] you disregard explicit instructions on the assignment
- [ ] you use unreasonable variable types
- [ ] you don’t declare your variables when you actually use them, but instead do them all “at the top of the code” and then assign values later
- [ ] you don't declare your constants at the top
- [ ] you include code that does nothing useful and/or indicates a lack of knowledge
- [ ] you **dare** to use (x == true) or (x == false) in your conditions

## Minor Issues

- [ ] you have 2 to 4 confusingly-named variables and/or constants
- [ ] you provide **truly** unnecessary comments
- [ ] you don’t use whitespace to separate your code into related “chunks”
- [ ] you don’t use whitespace in your expressions to space out operators, variable names, etc
- [ ] you use inconsistent bracing styles
- [ ] your prompts don’t have a space after them or move the cursor to the next line
