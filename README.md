# General Design Guidelines

- [ ] read the assignment instructions (including notes) carefully; ignoring instructions is a Bad Idea
- [ ] you should deliver the software you were asked to deliver - don't add extra features that aren't asked for

---

- [ ] choose your constant and variable names carefully - they should be easy to understand, descriptive, and never lie
- [ ] put all your constant declarations at the very top of your code (right after the run())
- [ ] whenever possible, declare variables at first use
- [ ] choose variable types that fit their purpose
- [ ] replace magic numbers that have **meaning** with well-named constants; if you can't find a good name, it's probably not a magic number you need to replace!

---

- [ ] you should briefly document things that aren't obvious and/or that come from external sources (a brief note and a URL is fine)
- [ ] you don't need to comment code that already speaks for itself

---

- [ ] strive for the ideal of "clean code": 
   - "Clean code is simple and direct. Clean code reads like well-written prose." [Grady Booch]
   - "You know you are working with clean code when [it]... turns out to be pretty much what you expected." [Ward Cunningham]
- [ ] all else being equal, it is better to be expressive than clever
- [ ] remove code that doesn't do anything
- [ ] keep an eye out for duplicate code; remove it whenever possible (and if removing it doesn't hurt readability)

---

- [ ] keep your inputs, outputs, and calculations separate

---

- [ ] use whitespace to improve readability, both within statments and between statements
- [ ] don't use (x == true) or (x == false) in your code
- [ ] be consistent: don't mix bracing styles, indentation, incrementation methods, etc.

---

- [ ] create prompts that are easy to understand by the end user
