# General Design Guidelines

Further explanation for the design portion of your marks.  

Every major issue I find bumps your design mark down by 1. (5 to a 4, 3 to a 2, etc.)  

Every 2 minor issues is worth 1 major issue. (So, for example, 3 minors + 1 major is like 2 majors. Kinda like Sushi Go's tempura scoring!)

## Major Issues

- [ ] you don’t provide comments for things that are not obvious 
- [ ] your variable and/or constant names aren’t expressive
    - ex. c or cost vs. costWordCents
- [ ] you disregard explicit instructions on the assignment
    - ex. forget to prompt when asked to
- [ ] you use unreasonable variable types (
    - ex. double numKittens
- [ ] you don’t declare your variables when you actually use them (contrast to writing them all “at the top of the code” and then given them values later)

## Minor Issues

- [ ] you provide really unnecessary comments
    - ex. // put numCards * 3 into variable score or // declare variable numKittens
- [ ] you don’t use whitespace to separate your code into related “chunks”
- [ ] you don’t use whitespace in your expressions to space out operators, variable names, etc
    - ex. int x=((3*y)/Math.min(4,length))+4*height (really hard to read!)
- [ ] you use inconsistent bracing styles
- [ ] your prompts don’t have a space after them
- [ ] your prompts move the cursor to the next line (ex. you use println())

## Just Comments

Some things in your code might be so minor that it would be cruel to ding you on them, but I do want you to be aware of them so that you can improve. Some examples:
- [ ] spelling mistakes (in comments, variables, constants)
- [ ] your prompts aren’t user friendly (“name?” instead of “Please enter your name “, for example)

For these kind of issues, I’ll put a comment in, but will not dock you marks.
